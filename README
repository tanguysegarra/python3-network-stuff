# python3 Network Stuff

Pieces of code I wrote in order to understand low-level networking in Python3.
The goal was to go from a very basic echo-server to a text-based game supporting multi-clients.
---
## Echo Server (support single-client only)

Once in python3-network-stuff/echo-server, do:

in a first terminal: ```./server.py```

in an another terminal: ```./client.py```

Then input a message to send from client,
Acknowledge server has received it properly,
And receive server response on client.

You can then start a new client without closing the server and connect the same way.

## Multi-Client TCP

## Protocols Game

Protocols Game based on silly game we played last time at the bar.

Python3 + network : client.py server.py

Each player has 10 seconds to give a protocol name that hasn't been given yet.
Last player standing is the winner.

print protocol definition each time a player gives it so you can learn in the same time.

PROS : really good to master protocols name.

CONS : once you know them all, quite pointless (but still funny lmao).

# TODO

* handle errors with try catch
* add flood to re-send message to all clients except sender
* configure user name when connecting
* pretty print conversation
* encryption
